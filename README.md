# Empire-api-sm

This is an API that I made for my project Empire-sm. This is a CRUD that allows me to manipulate the data of the products that I have in the frontend of Empire-sm. It was made with NodeJS and it is deployed on Vercel. Here's my project Empire-sm: https://github.com/SALVADORPOETA/Empire-sm
